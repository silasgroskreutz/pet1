THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

PROJECT PURPOSE:
Create a quick inventory lookup for Veterinary clinics for food.
There are times they are very busy and a "quick" look in the back may not be viable, which is why
I thought of creating this app.

TEcHNOLGY USED:
REACT on the front end; Node / Express on the backend with a SQL DB.
